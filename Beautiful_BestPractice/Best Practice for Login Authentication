1. Use SSL (https) for anything involving authentication
 

2. Use POST for anything submitting sensitive information
(and in general, don’t write sensitive information into logs)


3. Hash your passwords with a strong, certified, and slow
cryptographic one-way hashing scheme


4. Salt your hashes, using a separate salt for each string
you hash


5. Store your sensitive data separate from your regular data


6. Give your users the freedom to use whatever passwords
they want, above minimum security thresholds


7. Put a reasonable upper limit on access attempts from a
single location in a given time frame, and tell the user about failed access
attempt
 

8. Use a single failure message regardless of whether a user
is valid or a password was wrong
 

9. Don’t use “security questions” – they’re anything but

 

 Advance Method

1. Two-factor authentication

2. Email verification for unknown access locations

3. Account knowledge test for unknown access locations

4. Don’t force frequent password changes
